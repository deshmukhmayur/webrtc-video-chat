# Realtime communication with WebRTC

A simple demo app created by following the Codelab [Real time communication with WebRTC](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web).

This is the early preview that only works iin local mode. Will be adding more to it to make it an actual video chat app.
